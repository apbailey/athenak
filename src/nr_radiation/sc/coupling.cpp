//! \fn void SC::LimitDtByQrad
//! \brief Reduce Mesh::dt so that Q_rad removes at most cfl_qrad of any cell's internal
//! energy this step:  dt <= cfl_qrad * e_int / |Q|.
//!
//! Called at the end of SolveTransfer, i.e. in "before_timeintegrator", before any RK
//! stage has run. That placement is Athena-C's (radtrans_dt is called between
//! formal_solution and rad_to_hydro, main.c:687-689) and it matters: put this in
//! NewTimeStep instead, which runs in "stagen", and it would bound the NEXT cycle with
//! THIS cycle's Q -- leaving it inert on cycle 0, where qrad is still zero, after every
//! restart, and after every remesh, where qrad is not carried with the blocks.
//!
//! This is a second, independent upper bound, min-combined with the relaxation limit of
//! sc/newdt.cpp -- never multiplied by it. The relaxation limit is a linearised *rate*
//! and routes through sigma_a; it therefore bounds Eq. 27 (in the thin cooling limit
//! 1/nu_rad = (1/4) e_int/|Q^int| identically) but not Eq. 28, whose magnitude is set by
//! the radiation field. See theory/timestep-constraints.md Sec. 4 and 6.
//!
//! Only ever lowers dt, so the tlim clamp and the 2x growth cap in Mesh::NewTimeStep
//! cannot be violated, and the next cycle's cap keys off the reduced value.
